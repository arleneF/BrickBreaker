PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell dma_design_1_i/fifo_generator_0/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X48Y60 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell dma_design_1_i/fifo_generator_0/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
